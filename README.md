### **Getting Started with Terraform**  

Before provisioning resources with Terraform, follow these steps:  

1. **Create an IAM User**  
   - Log in to the AWS console and create a new IAM user.  

2. **Assign Required Permissions**  
   - Before deploying any resources, ensure the IAM user has the necessary permissions.  
   - You can attach policies directly or create a group with the required permissions and assign the user to that group in terraform.  

3. **Initialize Terraform**  
   - Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to validate and apply the IAM policies.  
   - Verify that all necessary permissions are successfully configured.  

4. **Start Creating Resources**  
   - Once the IAM setup is complete, proceed with creating AWS resources using Terraform.  

**Note:** If working with **public access S3 buckets**, ensure that the **Block Public Access** setting is disabled where required.
